TicTacToe is a simple game based on Xstate and React.js

Brief informations:
I have used React.js with styled components and Xstate to prepare my task. Every element is in separate component. 

Design Decisions:

My project is devided on few components. They have correct props flow beetween them. Xstate machine has got two main states and two enferior states. There are correct informations for winners or draw and which player move. I prepared only two simple test becouse of lack of time and experience, but I tried to make them as good as I can. More over after winning of one player, We can see particles on the screen.

To run code:

In main directory of project:
In terminal:
-npm install
-npm start

To run tests:
In main directory of project:
-npm tests
